About
-----

"AndroidMaterialPreferences" is an Android-library, which provides various preferences, which are 
designed according to Android 5.0's Material Desing guidelines even on pre-Lollipop devices.

The library provides the following preferences:

    -   A preference, which allows to enter a text via an EditText widget (EditTextPreference).
        
    -   A preference, which allows to select a value from a list (ListPreference).
    
    -	A preference, which allows to select multiple values from a list (MultiChoiceListPreference).
        
    -   A preference, which allows to choose a floating point value or an integer value from a 
        continuous range via a SeekBar widget (SeekBarPreference).
        
    -	A preference, which allows to choose a decimal value via a NumberPicker widget 
    	(NumberPickerPreference).
    	
    -	A preference, which allows to choose a decimal value, consisting of individual digits 
    	of which each can be chosen via a NumberPicker widget (DigitPickerPreference).
    	
    -	A preference, which allows to choose an image or video resolution via two EditText 
    	widgets (ResolutionPreference).
    	
    -	A preference, which allows to choose a color from a predefined color palette 
    	(ColorPalettePreference).
    	
    -	A preference, which provides a toggleable option using a Switch widget 
    	(SwitchPreference).

    -   The library uses the AppCompat v7 revision 21 support library in order to retrieve the 
        color of a the title and button texts of a preference's dialog from the applied theme. 
        Alternatively, these colors can be set manually.
